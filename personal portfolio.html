                I'm studying at Bharati Vidyapeeth's College Of Engineering For
                Women, Pune. Currently pursuing my degree in bachelors of Engineering. I'm in 3rd year Computer Engineering. My current cgpa is <b>8.85</b>
                I have interest in web development so I have applied to your Internship.I have hands on experiance on html and css and now Im learing more about bootstrap.
                I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. 
                In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do 
                better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and
                graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. 
                I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.
                I am highly organised. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical 
                filing method so I’m always able to find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and also helps the 
                rest of the team stay on track.<br>    I’m a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. 
                I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence.
                I’m a natural leader. I’ve eventually been promoted to a leadership role in almost every job because I like to help people. 
                I find co-workers usually come to me with questions or concerns even when I’m not in a leadership role 
                because if I don’t know the answer, I’ll at least point them in the right direction.<br>
